Tools for GURPS games

* `converter`: tool for converting [GURPS Character Sheet](http://gurpscharactersheet.com/) spell data files into a spreadsheet. It's designed to be used alongside [SpellCollegePrereqList](https://sites.google.com/site/nathanshomepage/Home/gurps) to get prereq counts. Versions of the input files, with some corrections, are also in this repository. Run as `./spell-convert.py gcs-library/Magic.spl spells-prereqs.csv > spells-merged.csv` or similar.
